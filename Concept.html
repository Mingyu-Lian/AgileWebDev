                A hyperlink, also known as a link or hypertext,
                is an element in computer technology that connects one document
                to another on the internet. It allows you to navigate from page
                to page with a single click.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typically, a hyperlink appears as an underlined piece of text,
                 but it can also be an image or icon. When clicked,
                 you can be taken to another webpage which may contain additional
                 information about the topic or provide more detail about what was discussed in the original document.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hyperlinks are essential for navigation around websites and allow users to quickly move from one topic
                 to another without having to type out a new web address each time.
            </p>

             <p>
                 They are also commonly used in emails and social media posts as a way
                  of providing easy access to more detailed information.

            <h2>What is a hyperlink used for?</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Hyperlinks are used to allow users to easily navigate from one page to another,
                 both within a website or between different websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                They can also be used to link back and forth between different sections of content on the same page,
                 allowing the user to quickly jump from one area to another with a single click.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, hyperlinks can be used in emails, social media posts and other digital documents
                 as a way of providing easy access for readers to more detailed information about a specific topic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hyperlinks can also be used as an effective tool for marketing,
                 allowing companies to direct customers to their products with just one click.
            </p>
            <p>
                With their versatility and convenience, it is no wonder that hyperlinks have
                become such an integral part of the online world we live in today.

                <p>
                    Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is a protocol or set of communication rules for client-server communication.
                    When you visit a website, your browser sends a HTTP request to the web server, which responds with an HTTP response.
                    The web server and your browser exchange data as plaintext.
                    In short, HTTP protocol is the underlying technology that powers network communication.
                    As the name suggests, hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is a more secure version or an extension of HTTP.
                    In HTTPS, the browser and server establish a secure, encrypted connection before transferring data.
                    https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-https-and-http/
                </p>
                <h3>how it works</h3>
                <p>
                    HTTP is an application layer protocol in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network communication model.
                     It defines several types of requests and responses. For example, when you want to view some data from a website, you send the HTTP GET request. If you want to send some information, like filling out a contact form, you send the HTTP PUT request.
                        Similarly, the server sends different types of HTTP responses in the form of number codes and data. Here are some examples:
                        200 - OK
                        400 - Bad request
                        404 - Resource not found
                        This request-response communication is usually invisible to your users. It’s the communication method that the browser and web servers use, so the World Wide Web works consistently for everyone.
                    
                </p>
